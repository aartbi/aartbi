## 👋 Hi, I'm Aarthi R
🎯 Aspiring Bioinformatics Engineer

🎓 I build reproducible bioinformatics pipelines using modern workflow tools
such as Nextflow, Conda, and Docker, with a focus on RNA-seq, metagenomics,
and variant analysis.

---

## 🔬 Bioinformatics Analysis Projects

- CRC Metagenomics Analysis
- scRNA-seq PBMC Analysis
- Rare Disease Whole Exome Sequencing
- Human RNA-seq Analysis
- Human Variant Calling analysis

These projects demonstrate biological data interpretation and analysis skills.

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline & Automation Projects

- Metadata-driven QC Pipeline
- RNA-seq QC Pipeline (FastQC + MultiQC)

These projects demonstrate workflow automation and pipeline design.

---

## 🔁 Nextflow Workflow Projects

- Reproducible RNA-seq QC Pipeline (Conda vs Docker ready)
- End-to-End RNA-seq Pipeline using Nextflow (Salmon, DESeq2) *(in progress)*

These projects demonstrate workflow orchestration and reproducibility.

---

## ☁️ Cloud Bioinformatics (Upcoming)

Pipelines designed to run on AWS using S3, EC2, and Docker containers.

---

## Tools & Technologies

Nextflow • FastQC • MultiQC • Salmon • DESeq2 • Python • Conda • Docker • Git • Linux

## 📈 What I Care About

✔ Reproducible pipelines  
✔ Production-quality QC  
✔ Clean documentation  
✔ Platform-ready workflows
